class ScopedObject(metaclass=ScopedObjectMeta):
    """An object whose lifetime must be bound to an ``async with`` block.

    Suppose that ``Foo`` is a :class:`ScopedObject` subclass. Then if
    you say ``Foo(*args)``, you won't actually get a ``Foo`` object;
    instead, you'll get an async context manager that evaluates to a
    ``Foo`` object.  So you would need to say::

        async with Foo(*args) as my_foo:
            # do stuff with my_foo

    This allows ``Foo`` to have reliable control of its lifetime, so
    it can spawn background tasks, deterministically execute cleanup
    code, and so on.

    If you want to implement such an object, inherit from :class:`ScopedObject`
    and indicate what should happen on entry and exit of the context.
    This should be done in one of the following two ways:

    * Define async ``__open__`` and/or ``__close__`` methods, which will
      be called from the context ``__aenter__`` and ``__aexit__`` respectively,
      taking no arguments and returning ``None``.
      ``__close__`` will be called no matter whether the context exits
      normally or due to an exception. (It can tell whether there is an
      active exception by using :func:`sys.exc_info`, but cannot suppress
      it.) If you use this approach, :class:`ScopedObject` takes care of
      invoking any initialization and finalization logic
      supplied by your base classes.

    * Define a ``__wrap__`` method that returns an async context
      manager.  This gives you more flexibility than implementing
      ``__open__`` and ``__close__``, because you can run some code
      outside of your base classes' scope and can swallow exceptions,
      but means you have to enter the base classes' scope yourself.

    It is an error to define both ``__wrap__`` and (``__open__`` or
    ``__close__``). If you don't define ``__wrap__``,
    :class:`ScopedObject` generates it for you in terms of
    ``__open__`` and ``__close__``, with semantics equivalent to the
    following::

        @asynccontextmanager
        async def __wrap__(self):
            async with super().__wrap__():
                if hasattr(self, "__open__"):
                    await self.__open__()
                try:
                    yield
                finally:
                    if hasattr(self, "__close__"):
                        await self.__close__()

    """
